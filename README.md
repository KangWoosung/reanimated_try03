## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Clear the bundler cache

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

## Commands.sh

npm install command may occur build errors in further future, since it's April.2025.
Use the commands in commands.sh line by line and follow the instruction for fresh versions of dependency packages.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
